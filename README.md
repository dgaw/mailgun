# Haskell Mailgun

This is a fork of the Haskell `mailgun` library.

The main purpose of this fork is to make the library compatible with GHC 8.2.

It may contain other features/modifications that I find useful.

The original library can be found on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mailgun) and the [author's GitLab](https://code.xkrd.net/haskell/mailgun).
